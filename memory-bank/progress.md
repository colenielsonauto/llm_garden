# Progress

## What Works

-   **Chat Interface:** Main UI (`src/app/page.tsx`) with message display, input, model selection (OpenAI, Grok, Gemini), file attachment placeholders.
-   **Backend API:** `/api/chat/route.ts` handles requests for OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini, selects API keys, calls respective APIs, and streams responses in Vercel AI SDK format.
-   **Authentication:** User login/signup via NextAuth.js (`/login`, `/api/auth/...`), session management, and route protection (`middleware.ts`).
-   **UI Components:** Sidebar, theme toggle, various input/button components from Shadcn UI.
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS theming.
-   **Web Search Toggle:** UI button exists in `page.tsx` and updates local state (`showSearch`).

## What's Left to Build

-   **Web Search Integration (Backend):**
    -   Implement Google Custom Search API call logic in `/api/chat/route.ts` when `useWebSearch` is true.
    -   Implement prompt augmentation with search results.
    -   Add error handling for search API failures.
-   **Web Search Integration (Frontend):**
    -   Pass the `showSearch` state to the backend via the `useChat` hook's `body`.
-   **File Upload Handling:** Actual backend logic to process and potentially use uploaded files as context (currently UI only).
-   **Refinements & Testing:**
    -   Improve error display/handling in UI.
    -   Add loading indicators (e.g., specific indicator during web search phase).
    -   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration) for chat, auth, and web search.
    -   Refine LLM instructions for handling web search context.

## Current Status

-   Core chat functionality with multiple LLMs and user authentication is operational.
-   Web search UI toggle is present but not functionally integrated with the backend.
-   Project is ready for implementing the web search logic in the backend API route and connecting the frontend toggle state.

## Known Issues

-   Middleware matcher (`/api/chat`, `/`) might need review for intended auth protection scope.
-   File uploads are not functional beyond the UI.
-   No specific loading state indication for the web search phase.
