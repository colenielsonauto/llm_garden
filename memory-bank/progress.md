# Progress (as of current session)

## What Works

-   Basic chat UI restored at `/`.
-   Backend API endpoint (`/api/chat`) for chat functionality.
-   API endpoint logic for OpenAI models.
-   Shadcn UI `auth-form` component added to the project.
-   Dedicated login page at `/login` displaying the `auth-form`.
-   Simulated authentication check on `/` redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`.
-   "Demo Login (Bypass)" button on `/login` allows accessing `/` via `localStorage` flag.

## What's Left to Build

-   Real user authentication logic (backend API, password hashing, session/token management).
-   Backend API endpoint for handling actual login/signup form submissions.
-   Database or storage solution for user credentials.
-   Replace simulated auth check (`localStorage`) with real session validation.
-   Implement sign-up functionality (UI and backend).
-   Remove/replace the "Demo Login" bypass.
-   Integration logic for other LLM providers (Grok, Claude, etc.) - (Post-auth).
-   Refactoring the API endpoint to easily accommodate multiple providers - (Post-auth).
-   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration) for auth and chat.

## Current Status

-   App structure includes a login page (`/login`) and a protected chat page (`/`).
-   Authentication is currently simulated using `localStorage` and a bypass button.
-   Chat UI is functional when accessed via the demo login.
-   Ready to implement real backend authentication.

## Known Issues

-   Authentication is not secure and relies on client-side `localStorage` flag.
-   Login form submission doesn't perform any actual login.
-   No sign-up functionality exists.
