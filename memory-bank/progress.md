# Progress (as of current session)

## What Works

-   Basic chat UI using Next.js and the Vercel `useChat` hook.
-   Backend API endpoint (`/api/chat`) successfully receives requests.
-   API endpoint correctly selects OpenAI API keys based on the requested model (`gpt-4.5-preview`, `gpt-4o`).
-   API endpoint successfully calls the OpenAI API using the `openai` library.
-   API endpoint correctly streams responses back to the frontend in the format required by `useChat`.
-   Chat interaction with OpenAI models is functional.

## What's Left to Build

-   Integration logic for other LLM providers (Grok, Claude, etc.).
-   Refactoring the API endpoint to easily accommodate multiple providers.
-   UI elements for potentially provider-specific features or settings.
-   More robust error handling and display on the frontend.
-   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration).
-   (Add other planned features)

## Current Status

-   Core chat functionality with OpenAI is established.
-   Ready to begin architectural planning and implementation for multi-provider support.

## Known Issues

-   (None identified in the current chat functionality, but please add any known bugs or limitations).

_This is an initial draft. Please update regularly with completed features, ongoing work, blocking issues, and refined next steps._
