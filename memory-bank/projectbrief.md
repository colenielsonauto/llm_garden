To create a web-based user interface for interacting with various Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Key Requirements

-   Allow users to send messages and receive streaming responses from selected LLMs.
-   Support multiple LLM providers (initially OpenAI, planned expansion to Grok, Claude, etc.).
-   Provide a clean and responsive user interface for chat interactions.
-   Manage API keys securely for different providers.
