# Product Context: LLM Chat UI

## Problem Solved

Provides a unified interface to access and compare different LLMs without needing separate tools or platforms for each one. Simplifies testing and interaction with various AI models.

## How it Works (High-Level)

-   Users select a desired LLM model from a list.
-   Users type messages into a chat input.
-   The frontend sends the message and selected model to a backend API endpoint.
-   The backend API routes the request to the appropriate LLM provider, authenticates, and streams the response back.
-   The frontend displays the streaming response in the chat interface.

## User Experience Goals

-   Fast, responsive streaming of text.
-   Clear indication of which model is being used.
-   Easy switching between models.
-   Reliable error handling and feedback.
